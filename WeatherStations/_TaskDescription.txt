In this task, your goal is to read data from the WeatherStation table and calculate statistics based on measurements from another source.



To do this, You should fill following methods:



IReadOnlyCollection<WeatherStation> GetActiveWeatherStationList(SQLiteConnection connection)



which should read data from WeatherStation table, joined with dictionary table WeatherStationType.

Also it should take only active stations (IsActive = 1) and sort them by name (ascending).



and



IReadOnlyCollection<TemperatureStatistics> GetTemperatureStatistics(

    IReadOnlyCollection<WeatherStation> weatherStations,

    IReadOnlyCollection<TemperatureMeasurement> temperatureMeasurements)



which should calculate average temperature for each station and return result sorted (ascending) by station name.

Hint:
Doing this computation try to join weatherStations and temperatureMeasurements collections in most efficient way.
Think about using some specialized collections to avoid O(n2) complexity.





Database model with sample data



  CREATE TABLE WeatherStationType (

    Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,

    Code TEXT NOT NULL        

  );



  INSERT INTO WeatherStationType (Code) VALUES ('Thermometer');

  INSERT INTO WeatherStationType (Code) VALUES ('UvSensor');

  INSERT INTO WeatherStationType (Code) VALUES ('SoilTemperatureMeasurer');



  CREATE TABLE WeatherStation (

    Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,

    Name TEXT NOT NULL,

    IsActive INTEGER NOT NULL,

    WeatherStationTypeId INTEGER NOT NULL,

    FOREIGN KEY (WeatherStationTypeId) REFERENCES WeatherStationType (Id)

  );



  INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('New York', 1, 1);

  INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('London', 1, 2);

  INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('Berlin', 1, 2);

  INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('Sydney', 0, 1);

  INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('Toronto', 1, 3);

  INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('Tokyo', 0, 1);

  INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('Paris', 1, 2);
