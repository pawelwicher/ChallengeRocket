# Weather Stations

## Task description

In this task, your goal is to read data from the **WeatherStation** table and calculate statistics based on measurements from another source.

To do this, You should fill following methods:

    Task<IReadOnlyCollection<WeatherStation>> GetActiveWeatherStationList()

which should read data from **WeatherStation** table, joined with dictionary table **WeatherStationType**. Also it should take only active stations and sort them by name.

and

    IReadOnlyCollection<TemperatureStatistics> GetTemperatureStatistics(
        IReadOnlyCollection<WeatherStation> weatherStations,
        IReadOnlyCollection<TemperatureMeasurement> temperatureMeasurements)

which should calculate average temperature for each station and return result sorted by station name.


## Database model with sample data

    CREATE TABLE WeatherStationType (
       Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
       Code TEXT NOT NULL               
    );

    INSERT INTO WeatherStationType (Code) VALUES ('Thermometer');
    INSERT INTO WeatherStationType (Code) VALUES ('UV Sensor');
    INSERT INTO WeatherStationType (Code) VALUES ('Soil Temperature Measurer');

    CREATE TABLE WeatherStation (
        Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        Name TEXT NOT NULL,
        IsActive INTEGER NOT NULL,
        WeatherStationTypeId INTEGER,
        FOREIGN KEY (WeatherStationTypeId) REFERENCES WeatherStationType (Id)
    );

    INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('New York', 1, 1);
    INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('London', 1, 2);
    INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('Berlin', 1, 2);
    INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('Sydney', 0, 1);
    INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('Toronto', 1, 3);
    INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('Tokyo', 0, 1);
    INSERT INTO WeatherStation (Name, IsActive, WeatherStationTypeId) VALUES ('Paris', 1, 2);
